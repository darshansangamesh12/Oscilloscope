# Oscilloscope Simulation Project  

## **Overview**  
This project simulates a virtual oscilloscope built in **LabVIEW 2021**, designed for real-time visualization and detailed analysis of waveforms. The application processes sine, square, and triangle waveforms while allowing users to analyze signal characteristics like amplitude, frequency, and phase.  

## **Features**  
- **Signal Visualization**: Displays generated waveforms in real-time.  
- **Measurement Tools**: Uses the "Extract Single Tone" VI for precise frequency, amplitude, and phase measurements.  
- **Cursor-based Analysis**: Enables detailed signal inspection by extracting data between user-defined cursors.  
- **Efficiency**: Designed for fast processing without additional software or toolkits.  

## **Technology Used**  
- **LabVIEW 2021**  
- Waveform Graphs, Signal Generators, Cursors, and Property Nodes  

## **How to Use**  
1. Clone the repository and open the project in LabVIEW 2021.  
2. Run the VI to start the oscilloscope simulation.  
3. Select waveform type (sine, square, or triangle) and observe the signal.  
4. Use cursors for detailed analysis and extract signal data as needed.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Add FFT analysis for frequency-domain visualization.  
- Implement data logging to save and replay signals.
